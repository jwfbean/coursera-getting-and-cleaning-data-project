# Final Project Codebook

A little confused since we don't generate the input data, so in this codebook I refer to the source.

## Data Source

The data is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Here are the data for the project:

## Input files
These files must be present in order for the program to run.

**features.txt**: Feature names listed here corresponds to column names in the training data set. Row numbers in
features.txt match column numbers in X_train.txt and X_test.txt.


activity_labels.txt: Activity labels listed here corresponds to the activity_label field in the tidy data set.
the assumed set of assumed activity labels is:
- 1 WALKING
- 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
- 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
- 4 SITTING
- 5 STANDING
- 6 LAYING

**train/X_train.txt**: Training data set

**train/y_train.txt**: Activity codes for the training data set, an integer value between 1-6, corresponding to the 
activity labels in activity_labels.txt and matching the train data set by row number.

**test/X_test.txt**: Test data set

**test/y_test.txt**: Activity codes for the test data set, an integer value between 1-6, corresponding to the activity
labels in activity_labels.txt and matching the test data set by row number.

## Field Selection

The project called for the average value for each mean and std deviation column in the data set per subject per 
activity type. Since the row numbers in features.txt match the column numbers in the data sets, the features file
is read and the rows are applied as column names. The fields are selected by feature name. Columns corresponding
to the features containing the text "mean" or "std" are selected. 

## Output data set:

Output data set rows consist of:
subject id from the data set
activity_label corresponding to the activity code corresponding to the labels associated with the data set as found in y_train.txt and y_test.txt
The additional columns (3-80) are numeric and have kept their names from the features file. In the output they contain the average measurement per subject per activity for the named feature. Units unchanged.

So the total output data set looks has these columns (as output by colnames function):

 [1] "subject"                         "activity_label"                  "tBodyAcc-mean()-X"

**TODO** change column names to indicate that they're averages
